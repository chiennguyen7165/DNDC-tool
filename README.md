# DNDC-tool

DNDC is very popular in the modelling community, but how the model organizes output files confuses users, especially when you work with multiple sites. This is a set of tools I created when I worked with DNDC and ran the model for around 30 sites simultaneously. I hope it saves time for those struggling with this kind of task.
